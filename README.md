# Hello there!

I am deep-diving into the web dev atmosphere after last being involved back in ~2015; a time when xHTML was hot, Ruby On Rails was just emerging and when I first learned about the difference between the [*em* dash and the *en* dash](https://alistapart.com/article/emen/). A once fairly avid [A List Apart](https://alistapart.com/) reader, I am sinking my teeth into all manner of topics today.

## Resources
Methodologies, tools and helpful sites I have used during this:
- [BEM Methodology](https://en.bem.info/methodology/ "BEM Methodology")
- [DevHints.io](https://devhints.io/ "DevHints.io")
